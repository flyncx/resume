# 📋 Résumé

My personal résumé written in LaTeX. Checkout the [latest release](https://github.com/flyncx/resume/releases/tag/latest).

## 🪟 Local Environment Setup (Windows)

To successfully build resume.tex to resume.pdf you will need to install:

- Perl ([Install Strawberry Perl with WinGet](https://winget.run/pkg/StrawberryPerl/StrawberryPerl))
- A TeX distribution ([Install MiKTeX on Windows](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex))
- PowerShell to run build.ps1
- VS Code with LaTeX Workshop extension (optional, but nice)
